##Vulnerability
MiniShare 1.4.1 has no bounds checking on HTTP GET requests it receives.
By sending a long, malformed HTTP GET request, an attacker can perform a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code on the system.

##Exploit Notes
- Only 210 bytes of space are available for shellcode after EIP is overwritten. 
	- Therefore, this exploit places the exploit shellcode into the "Host: " header of the GET request and makes use of egghunter shellcode to find the malicious shellcode in memory.
